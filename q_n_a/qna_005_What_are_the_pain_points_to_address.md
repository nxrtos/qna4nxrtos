# What are the pain points to address 

On many embedded system the resources are constrained, especially the RAM. Firmware developers have to program the right functionality with handful resources. This is even true to many of IoT devices and battery powered devices, where for direct manufacture cost and power consumption the RAM space has to kept small, meanwhile to support many communication protocols the firmware comes to be more complicated. It comes to be a great tension between system designer/electrical engineer and firmware developer. The system designer/electrical engineer insist to small RAM space on platform and firmware developer finds this comes to be extremely difficult and challenged work with such RAM space. 
 
So a programming model and framework can utilize RAM in efficiency is crucial. When find the conventional RTOS model causes many RAM to be inefficient usage, a new model and concepts brought up by nxRTOS, which promote lot of potential to firmware development.
