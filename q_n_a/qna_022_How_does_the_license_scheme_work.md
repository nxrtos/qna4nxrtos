# How does the license scheme work

The license model is still on discussion. At this moment we offer Open Source version free of charge for learning the concepts. The commercial version keep some features in close source and treat as intelligence property and commercial secret. The target commercial customer to be those massive electrical manufacture and charge for unit based license fee. 25 to 50 cents a unit? 

On current market, there are embedded license scheme to grant license key to against an UUID from microcontrollerâ€™s serial number or Bluetooth Address or MAC address etc. At this moment there is no code implementation in nxRTOS yet, and license scheme to nxRTOS is still on open discussion.
